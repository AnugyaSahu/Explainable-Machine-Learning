# Explainable Machine learning Exercises

Dataset
- Bike dataset to predict the number of bikes in a particular day (regression problem)
- Cervical Cancer Dataset to predict Biopsy (classification problem)

Methods and Exploration, What every exercise is about?

CE1-
- Random Forest regressor, Adjusted R2 Score
- Generation of  effect plot of the Lasso algorithm
- Interaction feature and Linear Regression assumptions

CE2-
- Logistic Regression, Odds ratio
- Decision Trees, Feature importance from Mean Decrease in Impurity
- RuleFit - Extract rules using CART and adding those rules as features then using LASSO
- Extract highest support attribute from rules

CE3-
- Partial Dependence Plots
- Individual Conditional Expectation plots
- M-plot
- Accumulated local effects
- Permutation feature importance

CE4 -
- Local post-hoc explanations
  1. Counterfactual explanations
  2. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations
  3. Shapley Additive explanations, Kernel SHAP
